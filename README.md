 This is work in progress

Using it is a bit complicated, but not that much

Install the Save Editor
Create a new directory in your desktop
Copy your new save file inside this new directory
Open the Save Editor
If you don't know where your save files are located, click on the Select Save on the editor, it will take you to save folder
Enter the name of your character inside the input field
Select the save file inside the desktop
It will show you the status of your character, if everything goes well it will say "Character Found! Infection Status: Infected/Clean
Click on Clear Infection
It will create a new save file named "UpdatedSaveFile.json"
Move the new file inside your save folder and rename it to the original save
Done!

I will try to simplfy this in the future updates if the community likes it, and expand upon it. 

I hope everyone enjoys it ðŸ™‚
